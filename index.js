// when we create the object we need to realocate the memory, and then after done we must dealocate -
// the memories, But it is not in a Javascript, we dont have to do this concept\

let circle = {};
console.log(circle); // output {}

// In javascript engine has built a Garbage Collector, that collecting every constanta that no use or no longer -
// Garbage Collector is working on the back screen, we dont need to worried because it handled by automatically
